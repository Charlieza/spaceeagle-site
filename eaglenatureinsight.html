<h2>Key Capabilities</h2>

<li><strong>Automated LEAP assessment:</strong> Locates your interface with nature, evaluates dependencies and impacts, assesses risks, and prepares an easy-to-share summary.</li>

<li><strong>SME friendly:</strong> Works with just a location and sector selection—no specialist environmental knowledge required.</li>
<li><strong>Low-bandwidth ready:</strong> Optimised for mobile and intermittent connectivity, so it can be used in remote or under-served areas.</li>
